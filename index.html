<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started you&#39;ll need the following pre-requisites. Please take a few moments to ensure everything is installed and configured.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows PC or Mac or Linux. Just have a laptop.</li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure Subscription</a> (Trial is ok, or an Azure account linked to a Visual Studio subscription. See later sections of this chapter to create a free trial account or activate your Visual Studio subscription)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-you-re-building">What You&#39;re Building</h3>
<p>Azure is big. Really big. Too big to talk about all things Azure in a single day. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve assembled an exciting workshop to introduce you to several Azure services that cloud developers should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/">Web app</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/">Key Vault</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/">Azure SQL Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/">Event Hub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/">API Management</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/">Cosmos DB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/">Virtual Machines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In today&#39;s workshop, you&#39;ll get started with Azure and learn how to navigate through the Azure portal! You&#39;ll activate a free Azure subscription, learn about Resource Groups, and navigate through the Azure portal. You&#39;ll also create your development environment virtual machine running Visual Studio Community Edition.</p>
<p>Next, you&#39;ll learn about Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings while creating a simple web app to manage data stored in an Azure SQL database. You&#39;ll finish by securing the data connection between your application and the database using an MSI (Managed Service Identity), then deploying to Azure services that host your web app.</p>
<p>Once your app is up and running, we&#39;ll teach you how your app can be restructured for scalability by separating the backend data access later into a separately-hosted ASP.NET Web API app. You&#39;ll also learn how to secure your service.</p>
<p>After you&#39;ve built and deployed a REST API, you&#39;ll learn how you can use Azure Functions and Cosmos DB to aggregate your data and ready it for consumption by the public.</p>
<p>Finally, after developing a database of publicly-consumable data, we&#39;ll explore how to advertise the data publicly as an API using App Services, Web API, and API Management. See how it&#39;s easy to have customers request access to the data, subscribe to your service, and generate additional revenue.</p>
<p>Essentially...</p>

<h3 id="preparing-your-azure-environment">Preparing your Azure environment</h3>
<p>You might be wondering how you can participate in a cloud development workshop and not need any software installed.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Azure Resource Manager and some nifty templates I put together, we&#39;re going to provision a virtual machine (VM) with Visual Studio (and all the tools you&#39;ll need) installed in your Azure subscription. From that point forward, you can work from the VM. </p>
<p>It takes about 10 minutes to get the VM deployed to your subscription, so let&#39;s get started!</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Provisioning a Visual Studio Community VM in your Azure Subscription
</h4>

<p>Start by clicking the <em>Deploy to Azure</em> button below.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmikebranstein%2Fvscommunity-workshop-vm%2Fmaster%2Ftemplate.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" class="img-override" /></a></p>
<p>This opens the Azure portal in a new tab of your browser. If you&#39;re prompted to sign in, do so. </p>
<p>When the page loads, you&#39;ll see this custom deployment page:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter0/custom-deployment.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<h4 id="under-basics-select-enter-the-following">Under <em>Basics</em>, select/enter the following</h4>
<ul>
<li>Subscription: <em>your Azure subscription</em></li>
<li>Resource group: <em>Create new</em></li>
<li>Resource group name: <em>workshop-rg</em>, or some other name that&#39;s easy to remember</li>
<li>Location: <em>East US</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resource Groups</strong> </p>
<p>Formally, resource groups provide a way to monitor, control access, provision and manage billing for collections of assets that are required to run an application, or used by a client or company department. Informally, think of resource groups like a file system folder, but instead of holding files and other folders, resource groups hold azure objects like storage accounts, web apps, functions, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Naming Resource Groups</strong> </p>
<p>I like to name my resource groups after their purpose, and append them with <em>-rg</em>, which signifies they are a resource group. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="under-settings-enter">Under <em>Settings</em>, enter</h4>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Machine Name: <em>workshop-vm</em>, or some other name that is less than 15 characters long, and no special characters</li>
<li>Admin Username: <em>your first name</em>, or some other username without spaces</li>
<li>Admin Password: <em>P@ssW0rd1234</em>, or another 12-character password with upper, lower, numbers, and a special character </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> </p>
<p>Do not forget your username and password. Write it down for today. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="approving-the-purchase">Approving the &quot;Purchase&quot;</h4>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click two boxes:</p>

<p>After a few moments, the deployment of your VM will begin, and you&#39;ll see a status notification in the upper right:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter0/deployment-start1.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>...and a deployment tile on your dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter0/deployment-start2.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Now, wait for about 10 minutes and your virtual machine will be deployed and ready to use.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>That&#39;s it for the pre-requisites for today&#39;s workshop. Wait until your VM is created, and we&#39;ll be getting started soon!</p>

				<h2 id="getting-started-in-azure">Getting started in Azure</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Before we go any further, be sure you have all the pre-requisites downloaded and installed. You&#39;ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows PC or Mac</li>
<li>Evergreen web browser (Edge, Chrome, Firefox)</li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure Subscription</a> (trial is ok, and you should have already done this in the chapter 0)</li>
<li>A Visual Studio Community edition VM running in Azure (see chapter 0 for setting this up)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;ve been following along, you should have all of these above items. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="organizing-your-resources-in-the-azure-portal">Organizing your resources in the Azure portal</h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects of your Azure subscription and using the Azure portal is organization. You can create a lot of Azure resources very quickly in the portal, and it can become cluttered quickly. So, it&#39;s important to start your Azure subscription off right.</p>
<p>Our first stop will be to create a new Dashboard to organize our Azure resources we&#39;re building today.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Create a Dashboard
</h4>

<h4 id="creating-a-dashboard">Creating a Dashboard</h4>
<p>We&#39;ll start by creating a dashboard. </p>
<p>Login to the Azure portal, click <em>+</em>, give the dashboard name, and click <em>Done customizing</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/new-dashboard.gif" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>That was easy! Dashboards are a quick way of organizing your Azure services. We like to create one for the workshop because it helps keep everything organized. You&#39;ll have a single place to go to find everything you build today.</p>
<h4 id="pinning-a-resource-group-to-the-dashboard">Pinning a Resource Group to the Dashboard</h4>
<p>Now that you have a new dashboard, let&#39;s put something on it. We&#39;ll be searching for the resource group you created in chapter 0 (the one that is holding your VM), and pinning it to this dashboard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resource Groups</strong> </p>
<p>You&#39;ll recall from the last chapter that resource groups provide a way to monitor, control access, provision and manage billing for collections of assets that are required to run an application, or used by a client or company department. Informally, think of resource groups like a file system folder, but instead of holding files and other folders, resource groups hold azure objects like storage accounts, web apps, functions, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start by searching for the resource group you created in chapter 0. My resource group was called <em>workshop-rg</em>. </p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/find-resource-group.gif" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Click in the search bar at the top. If you&#39;re lucky your resource group will be at the very top (like mine was). If not, type it&#39;s name and click on it.</p>
<p>This opens the resource group. Next, click the <em>pin</em> icon at the upper-right to pin the resource group to your dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/pin-resource-group.png" class="img-large" /></p>
<p>Finally, close the resource group, by clicking the <em>X</em> in the upper right corner (next to the <em>pin</em> icon). You should see the resource group pinned to your dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/pinned.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Now that you have the VM&#39;s resource group pinned to your dashboard, it will be easy to locate the VM in later exercises.</p>
<p>Go ahead and click ont he Virtual machine, then pin it to the dashboard. When you&#39;re finished, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/vm-pin.gif" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>That wraps up the basics of creating dashboard, creating resource groups, and pinning resources to a dashboard. We&#39;re not going to take a deep dive into Azure Resource Group. If you&#39;re interested in learning more, check out this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal">article</a>.</p>
<h3 id="logging-into-your-virtual-machine">Logging into your virtual machine</h3>
<p>Next, let&#39;s get logged into the VM that we created in chapter 0. </p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Logging into your VM
</h4>

<p>Start by navigating to your Azure portal dashboard. </p>
<p>Locate the VM resource group you pinned earlier in this chapter and click on your virtual machine:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/click-vm.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Click the <em>Connect</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/connect.png"/></p>
<p>This displays a download window on the right. Press the <em>Download RDP file</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/connect-download.png" /></p>
<p>This downloads a file to your computer that will open in your Remote Desktop program.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/connect-download-2.png" /></p>
<p>Click the downloaded file to open a connection to your VM. Enter your username and password you created earlier. </p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/connect-password.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Click <em>OK</em> to connect.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re prompted by a security message, respond <em>Yes</em>:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/connect-security.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>You&#39;re now connected to your VM. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Download additional software</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;re like me, you have a standard toolset you like to use. Please, download software for your VM and don&#39;t forget your browser of choice, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This concludes the exercise.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>Now that you&#39;re connected to your VM, you can continue to workshop from inside the VM. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Running a VM in Azure</strong> </p>
<p>If you&#39;re worried about excessive charges to your Azure subscription because you&#39;re running a VM constantly, don&#39;t worry. This VM is programmed to shut itself down every evening at 7:00 PM EST. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="clone-project-from-master-branch">Clone project from master branch</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s get started by getting the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Getting the bootcamp files
</h4>

<p>Clone or download the <code>master</code> branch from <a href="https://github.com/mikebranstein/global-azure-bootcamp-2019">https://github.com/mikebranstein/global-azure-bootcamp-2019</a>.</p>
<p>Use this <a href="https://github.com/mikebranstein/global-azure-bootcamp-2019/archive/master.zip">link</a> to download a zip file of the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/downloaded-zip.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unblock the .zip file!</strong> </p>
<p>Don&#39;t open the zip file yet. You may need to unblock it first!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re running Windows, right-click the zip file and go to the properties option. Check the <em>Unblock</em> option, press <em>Apply</em>, press <em>Ok</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/unblock.gif" /></p>
<p>Now it&#39;s safe to unzip the file. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="about-contoso-university">About Contoso University</h3>
<p>The Contoso University web app is a small app that is used to manage the faculty, students, courses, and grades of Contoso University. It&#39;s not very advanced, but comes with pre-seeded data, and is ideal to demonstrate the concepts of this workshop.  </p>
<h3 id="verify-the-site-works">Verify the site works</h3>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Compiling the solution
</h4>

<p>Before we can compile the solution, we need ot ensure .NET Core 2.2 is installed on your virtual machine.</p>
<p>Locate and run <em>Visual Studio Installer</em> from the Start Menu:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/vs-installer.png" /></p>
<p>Select the <em>Modify</em> option under Visual Studio 2019:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/modify.png" /></p>
<p>On the right, expand the section labeled <em>.NET Core cross-platform development</em>, and check the box labeled <em>.NET Core 2.2 development tools</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/core-22.png" /></p>
<p>Click the <em>Modify</em> button on the bottom to install. The install takes approx. 5 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>When the install is finished, you can update Visual Studio 2019 to the latest version (if you want), but it isn&#39;t necessary.</p>
<p>Next, open the solution in <strong>Visual Studio 2019</strong> by double-clicking the <code>ContosoUniversity.sln</code> file in the <em>src</em> folder of the extracted files:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/solution-file.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Logging into Visual Studio the first time</strong></p>
<p>When you open Visual Studio the first time, it may take a few minutes. Be patient. You&#39;ll probably be prompted to sign in. Use your Microsoft account to sign in (the same one you used to sign up for the Azure trial).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opened solution should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/opened-solution.png" /></p>
<p>Build and debug the solution. You should see the Speech Recognition site load in your browser.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/site.png" /></p>
<p>This concludes the exercise.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>That&#39;s it! You&#39;re up and running and ready to move on! In the next section, you&#39;ll learn how to deploy your website to Azure.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-app-service-and-web-apps">Understanding App Service and Web Apps</h3>
<p>In the last part of this chapter, you&#39;ll learn how to create an Azure Web App and deploy the Speech Service website to the cloud. In short, I like to think of Azure Web Apps like IIS in the cloud, but without the pomp and circumstance of setting up and configuring IIS.</p>
<p>Web Apps are also part of a larger Azure service called the App Service, which is focused on helping you to build highly-scalable cloud apps focused on the web (via Web Apps), mobile (via Mobile Apps), APIs (via API Apps), and automated business processes (via Logic Apps). </p>
<p>We don&#39;t have time to fully explore all of the components of the Azure App Service, so if you&#39;re interested, you can read more <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/">online</a>.</p>

<p>As we&#39;ve mentioned, Web Apps are like IIS in the cloud, but calling it that seems a bit unfair because there&#39;s quite a bit more to  Web Apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Websites and Web Apps:</strong> Web Apps let developers rapidly build, deploy, and manage powerful websites and web apps. Build standards-based web apps and APIs using .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Java. Deliver both web and mobile apps for employees or customers using a single back end. Securely deliver APIs that enable additional apps and devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Familiar and fast:</strong> Use your existing skills to code in your favorite language and IDE to build APIs and apps faster than ever. Access a rich gallery of pre-built APIs that make connecting to cloud services like Office 365 and Salesforce.com easy. Use templates to automate common workflows and accelerate your development. Experience unparalleled developer productivity with continuous integration using Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub, and live-site debugging.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enterprise grade:</strong> App Service is designed for building and hosting secure mission-critical applications. Build Azure Active Directory-integrated business apps that connect securely to on-premises resources, and then host them on a secure cloud platform that&#39;s compliant with ISO information security standard, SOC2 accounting standards, and PCI security standards. Automatically back up and restore your apps, all while enjoying enterprise-level SLAs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Build on Linux or bring your own Linux container image:</strong> Azure App Service provides default containers for versions of Node.js and PHP that make it easy to quickly get up and running on the service. With our new container support, developers can create a customized container based on the defaults. For example, developers could create a container with specific builds of Node.js and PHP that differ from the default versions provided by the service. This enables developers to use new or experimental framework versions that are not available in the default containers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Global scale:</strong> App Service provides availability and automatic scale on a global datacenter infrastructure. Easily scale applications up or down on demand, and get high availability within and across different geographical regions. Replicating data and hosting services in multiple locations is quick and easy, making expansion into new regions and geographies as simple as a mouse click.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Optimized for DevOps:</strong> Focus on rapidly improving your apps without ever worrying about infrastructure. Deploy app updates with built-in staging, roll-back, testing-in-production, and performance testing capabilities. Achieve high availability with geo-distributed deployments. Monitor all aspects of your apps in real-time and historically with detailed operational logs. Never worry about maintaining or patching your infrastructure again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deploying-to-a-web-app-from-visual-studio">Deploying to a Web App from Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Now that you understand the basics of web apps, let&#39;s create one and deploy our app to the cloud! </p>
<p>Earlier in this chapter, you created a resource group to house resources for this workshop. You did this via the Azure Portal. You can also create Web Apps via the Azure portal in the same manner. But, I&#39;m going to show you another way of creating a Web App: from Visual Studio.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Deploying to a Web App from Visual Studio 2017
</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Visual Studio 2019 Warning</strong> </p>
<p>This exercise assumes you&#39;re running Visual Studio 2019. If you&#39;re not, please do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Visual Studio, right-click the <em>ContosoUniversity</em> project and select <em>Publish</em>. In the web publish window, select <em>Microsoft Azure App Service</em>, <em>Create New</em>, and press <em>Publish</em>. This short clip walks you through the process:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/publish-web-app.gif" class="img-large" /></p>
<p>On the next page, give your Web App a name, select your Azure subscription, and select the Resource Group you created earlier (mine was named <em>workshop-rg</em>), and create a new Free App Service Plan. Read below for more details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unique Web App Names</strong></p>
<p>Because a web app&#39;s name is used as part of it&#39;s URL in Azure, you need to ensure it&#39;s name is unique. Luckily, Visual Studio will check to ensure your web app name is unique before it attempts to create it. In other words, don&#39;t try to use the web app name you see below, because I already used it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/web-app-settings.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Click <em>New...</em> to create a new Web App plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Web App Plans</strong> </p>
<p>Web App plans describe the performance needs of a web app. Plans range from free (where multiple web apps run on shared hardware) to not-so-free, where you have dedicated hardware, lots of processing power, RAM, and SSDs. To learn more about the various plans, check out this <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/plans/">article</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Create a new free plan.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/new-plan.png" /></p>
<p>After the plan is created, click <em>Create</em> to create the Web App in Azure.</p>
<p>When the Azure Web App is created in Azure, Visual Studio will publish the app to the Web App. After the publish has finished, your browser window will launch, showing you your deployed website. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Web App URLs</strong></p>
<p>The deployed web app has a URL of <em>Web App Name</em>.azurewebsites.net. Remember this URL, because you&#39;ll be using it in later chapters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One final note is to check the Azure Portal to see the App Service plan and Web App deployed to your resource group:</p>

				<h2 id="connecting-an-azure-sql-database">Connecting an Azure SQL Database</h2>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;ll learn about Azure SQL Database, how to provision one in the Azure Portal, and how to use Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to seed a local (development database) and an Azure SQL Database.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Azure SQL Database is a general-purpose relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on the latest stable version of Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine. SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, and secure cloud database that you can use to build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="provisioning-in-azure">Provisioning in Azure</h3>
<p>Now that you know what Azure SQL Database can do, let&#39;s start using it! You&#39;ll start by creating a SQL Database instance in the Azure portal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SQL Servers and Databases</strong></p>
<p>When creating a SQL Database, you also need to create a SQL Server. The steps below walk you through this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Creating a SQL Server and Database instance
</h4>

<p>Start by jumping back to the Azure portal, and create a new resource by clicking the <em>Create a resource</em> button.</p>
<p>Search for <em>SQL Database</em>:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/sql-search.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Fill out the required parameters as you create an instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource group: the resource group you created earlier</li>
<li>Database name: ContosoUniversity3</li>
<li>Server: <em>Press Create new button</em>, complete right side panel</li>
<li>Server name: unique SQL server name to create</li>
<li>Server admin login: workshopAdmin</li>
<li>Password: <em>Enter complex password</em>, write it down</li>
<li>Location: East US</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/create-sql.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Press the <em>Select</em> button after completing the server information in the right panel, then press <em>Review and create</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/sql-review-create.png" /></p>
<p>When the SQL Server and database instances are provisioned, they appear in your resource group:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/sql-deployed.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>The final step is to navigate to the SQL Server instance by clicking on it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Secured by default</strong></p>
<p>As with most Azure resources, SQL Server is secured by default, meaning that you cannot access the SQL Server or databases without opening up the attached firewall. In this next step, we&#39;ll do just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Locate the <em>Firewalls and virtual networks</em> area, click <em>Show firewall settings</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/sql-firewall.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add client IP</em> button and notice an entry being made in the table below. Then, click <em>Save</em>. This opens the SQL Server firewall to allow you to communicate with it directly for the duration of the workshop.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/add-client-ip.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Next, navigate to the <em>SQL Databases</em> link on the left, and select the ContosoUniversity3 database.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/nav-sql.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Click the <em>Show database connection strings</em> link:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/conn-strings.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Copy the connection string and paste it into Notepad, or another text editor:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/copy-conn-string.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>After pasting the connections tring into a text editor, locate the <code>{your_username}</code> and <code>{your_password}</code> sections and update them with the SQL Server username and password you created previously.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/update-conn-string.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Save this connection string -- you&#39;ll need it later!</p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="seeding-your-databases">Seeding your databases</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that the Contoso University app crashes when you navigate to various pages. That&#39;s because it&#39;s expecting a database exists, but we haven&#39;t created it.</p>
<p>In this next step, we&#39;ll use Entity Framework&#39;s Migrations to create and seed a local SQL database, then do the same for the Azure SQL Database we just created.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Seeding the local SQL Database
</h4>

<p>Every installation of Visual Studio 2019 comes with a development version of SQL Server called MS SQL Local DB. In fact, the Contoso University app is pre-configured to use this SQL Server instance already.</p>
<p>Open the <code>appsettings.json</code> file to see the connection string:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;ConnectionStrings&quot;: {
    &quot;DefaultConnection&quot;: &quot;Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ContosoUniversity3;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true&quot;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the server name of <strong>(localdb)\mssqllocaldb</strong>. This is the local development version of SQL I mentioned above. We&#39;ll use this in the next section to &quot;seed&quot; the database with Entity Framework Migrations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Entity Framework and Migrations</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with Entity Framework and Migrations, don&#39;t worry. Entity Framework (EF) is a technology called an object-relational mapper (O/RM). O/RMs (like EF) enable .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write (like stored procedures, views, and queries). </p>
<p>EF Migrations are a way to use .NET objects and code to create a SQL database and tables, then seed the database with preliminary data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Contoso University app already has Entity Framework installed and configured. Let&#39;s use it to create the ContosoUniversity3 database locally by running the migrations.</p>
<h4 id="using-ef-migrations">Using EF Migrations</h4>
<p>In Visual Studio, go to the <em>Tools</em> menu, select <em>NuGet Package Manager</em>, then <em>Package Manager Console</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/open-pm.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>This opens a new area at the bottom of Visual Studio:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/pm-console.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>In the Package Manager Console, change the Default project to <em>ContosoUniversityData</em>, the type <em>Update-Database</em> and press <em>Enter</em>. The EF Migrations will read the connection string from your configuration file, create the ContosoUniversity3 database, create the tables, and load seed data into the tables. You can see the process happening below:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/ef-migrations.gif" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>When the EF Migrations have finished, run the web site, and navigate to the <em>Courses</em> page. You will see the page displays a variety of course data:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/courses.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve used EF Migrations, let&#39;s seed the ContosoUniversity3 database in Azure. </p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Seeding the Azure SQL Database
</h4>

<p>Open the <code>appsettings.json</code> file to adjust the connection string. You&#39;llrecall that we saved the Azure SQL Database connection string in our text editor earlier. Copy the value and paste it into the configuration file.</p>
<p>Mine looks like:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter2/appsettings.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Now that the connection string has been updated, return to the Package Manager Console and run the EF Migrations again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ContosoUniversityData project</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t forget to change the default project to ContosoUniversityData before running the migrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt; Update-Database
</code></pre><p>This will use the updated connection string to provision and seed the ContosoUniversity3 database in Azure.</p>
<p>When the migrations have finished, run the website to verify it still works. </p>
<p>Now, as a final step, re-deploy your web app to Azure, so it has the updated connection string (pointing to your Azure SQL Database).</p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>That&#39;s it. In the next chapter, you&#39;ll learn how to secure your connection string so it isn&#39;t visible int he configuration file.</p>

			<div class="chapter">
				<h2 id="increasing-the-security-of-deployed-apps">Increasing the Security of Deployed Apps</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you&#39;ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to secure secrets (like SQL databse connection strings) with Key Vaults</li>
<li>How to add authentication to your web apps instantly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="securing-secrets-in-web-apps">Securing Secrets in Web Apps</h3>
<p>Since the early days of .NET, developers have been putting SQL database connection strings in configuration files. This is not only a bad practice, but a serious security risk for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>login credentials are saved in plain-text </li>
<li>it&#39;s easy to accidentally check in the credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the risks of plain-text credentials, developers started encrypting the vaules, but this brought challenges with how to encrypt and decrypt, and made a developer&#39;s job more difficult.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/better-way.gif" /></p>
<p>There&#39;s got to be a better way!</p>
<h4 id="key-vault-to-the-rescue-">Key Vault to the Rescue!</h4>
<p>Introducing Key Vault! Azure Key Vault helps solve the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secrets Management</strong>: Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets</li>
<li><strong>Key Management</strong>: Azure Key Vault can also be used as a Key Management solution. Azure Key Vault makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Management</strong>: Azure Key Vault is also a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.</li>
<li><strong>Store secrets backed by Hardware Security Modules</strong>: The secrets and keys can be protected either by software or FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validates HSMs</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with Key Vault, you store your connection strings inside of a secret store instead of in your app configuration file. Then, you simply store the location or URL of the Key Vault in your config file, so when your app starts up, you access the Key Vault, extract your secrets, then continue on as normal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But wait...don&#39;t I need a secret/password to access a Key Vault</strong></p>
<p>Yes you do, but it doesn&#39;t make much sense to store that secret inside of your app configuration file. Afterall, that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re trying to avoid!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="accessing-keyvault-without-a-password">Accessing KeyVault without a Password</h4>
<p>That&#39;s right. You can actually access the Key Vault without a password - at least a password that you&#39;re aware of. </p>
<p>The second critical component to securing your app secrets is something called a Managed Service Identity (or MSI for short). You can think of an MSI like a service account, but a service account that doesn&#39;t have a password. </p>
<p>Within Azure, you can assign an MSI to a Web App, so when the app runs it &quot;acts&quot; or &quot;takes on&quot; the role of the MSI. So, once it&#39;s been assigned to a Web App, you can give the Web App MSI permissions to access your Key Vault. </p>
<p>To the developer, this seems like magic - when you app runs, it becomes an MSI, then has permissions to access the Key Vault without a password. But behind the scenes Azure is managing the entire process, ensuring your Web App is the only resource using the assigned MSI.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-an-msi-to-your-web-app">Assigning an MSI to your Web App</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s get started by assigning an MSI to your web app!</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Assigning an MSI through the Azure Portal
</h4>

<p>Navigate to the web app you deployed in an earlier chapter. Mine was called <em>contoso-web-meb</em>.</p>
<p>Scroll down on the left to find a section named <em>Identity</em>. Click on <em>Identity</em>:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/identity.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>On the <em>System assigned</em> tab, change the status to <em>On</em> and press <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/system-assigned.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Click <em>Yes</em> when prompted.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/accept.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>...and that&#39;s it! Your MSI (Managed Service Identity) is assigned. </p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/assigned.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 

<h3 id="creating-a-key-vault">Creating a Key Vault</h3>
<p>Now that you have an MSI assigned to your web app, it&#39;s time to create a Key Vault and give the MSI access to read secrets.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Creating a Key Vault and Assigning Access
</h4>

<p>In the Azure portal, search for the Key Vault by searching for it, like you did the SQL Database in an earlier chapter.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/search-kv.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Place the Key Vault in the resource group you created for the workshop:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/create-kv.png" /></p>
<p>Click the <em>Access policies</em> section, then the <em>+ Add new</em> link to add the web app MSI to the Key Vault&#39;s authorized users:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/access-policies-kv.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <em>Secret management</em> from the <em>Configure from template</em> option</li>
<li>Click <em>Select principal</em></li>
<li>In the box to the right, type the name of your web app (mine was contoso-web-meb)</li>
<li>Click your web app&#39;s name when it appears below</li>
<li>Click the <em>Select</em> button</li>
<li>Click <em>Ok</em></li>
</ol>
<p>You should now see your web app added:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/added.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Click <em>Ok</em> to return to the Key Vault creation screen, and <em>Create</em> to provision the Key Vault.</p>
<p>It will take a few minutes to deploy the Key Vault. When it&#39;s finished provisioning, pin it to your dashboard (we&#39;ll be using it a lot today).</p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 


<h3 id="adding-secrets-to-the-key-vault">Adding Secrets to the Key Vault</h3>
<p>Now that you have created a Key Vault and assigned access to it, let&#39;s add a secret!</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Adding a secret to a Key Vault
</h4>

<p>Navigate to your Key Vault and select the <em>Secrets</em> area on the left:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/secrets.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Click <em>Generate/Import</em>. </p>
<p>For the secret name, enter <em>ConnectionStrings--DefaultConnection</em>. Copy and paste your conneciton string from the app configuration file for the value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Secret Names Matter</strong></p>
<p>Go back and look at the app configuration file for Contoso University. You&#39;ll notice the JSON structure has a ConnectionStrings key following by a sub key of DefaultConnection. This is important. </p>
<p>In Key Vault, we&#39;ll mimick this struture by using the same key names and a double dash for the key name. Later, when we tell our web app to read the Key Vault secrets, it will be able to parse the secret name and dynamically replace the correct key/value pair in our configuration file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/create-secret.png" /></p>
<p>Click <em>Create</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/created.png" /></p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 

<h3 id="incorporating-key-vault-access-into-web-apps">Incorporating Key Vault Access into Web Apps</h3>
<p>Now that we have secrets in our Key Vault, let&#39;s configure the web app to access the Key Vault. </p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Configuring a Web App to read configuration from a Key Vault
</h4>

<p>To configure the Contoso University app to read configuration data from the Key Vault, we need to modify the app&#39;s startup process to load it&#39;s current ocnfiguraiton file, then reach out to the Key Vault, read the secrets, and dynamically load the secret values into our configuration.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start by adding a few NuGet packages to the ContosoUniversity project.</p>
<p>Right-click the Solution, and add the following packages. <strong>Be midful to add the specific version(s) we&#39;ve specified below!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication, v1.2.0-preview2</li>
<li>Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault, v2.2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, create a new class in the root of the ContosoUniversity project named <code>PrefixKeyVaultSecretManager.cs</code>. Place the following code inside.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-c#">using Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Models;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ContosoUniversity
{
    public class PrefixKeyVaultSecretManager : IKeyVaultSecretManager
    {
        public string GetKey(SecretBundle secret)
        {
            // Remove the prefix from the secret name and replace two 
            // dashes in any name with the KeyDelimiter, which is the 
            // delimiter used in configuration (usually a colon). Azure 
            // Key Vault doesn&#39;t allow a colon in secret names.
            return secret.SecretIdentifier.Name
                .Replace(&quot;--&quot;, ConfigurationPath.KeyDelimiter);
        }

        public bool Load(SecretItem secret)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can think of htis class as a <em>conversion</em> class. The <em>GetKey()</em> function is called each time a key/value pair is restrived from the Key Vault. The function then translates any double dashes into colons. This is an important step because .NET Core apps (like this one) natively translate colons into a heirarchical configuraiton file manner when parsing config values. </p>
<p>So, a value of <em>ConnectionStrings--DefaultConnection</em> is translated by the <em>GetKey()</em> function into <em>ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection</em>. Then, .NET Core reads the string and replaces the configuration key of ConnectionStrings with sub key DefaultConnection with the value pulled from the Key Vault.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why not use colons in the Key Vault secret?</strong></p>
<p>You may be wondering why we had to convert double dashes into colons. Unfortunately, key vault key names cannot contain colons, so some type of replacement delimiter must be used. I chose a double dash. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, update the <em>CreateWebHostBuilder()</em> function in the <code>Program.cs</code> file to tie everything together. After updaitng the function, don&#39;t forget to add the missing references at top. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-c#">public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, builder) =&gt;
        {
            // only run in &quot;production&quot; mode, so you don&#39;t override 
            // config values when running locally for development
            if (context.HostingEnvironment.IsProduction())
            {
                var config = builder.Build();

                // get MSI token from running web app
                var tokenProvider = new AzureServiceTokenProvider(); 

                // create kv client, passing MSI token for authorization
                var keyvaultClient = new KeyVaultClient((authority, resource, scope)
                    =&gt; tokenProvider.KeyVaultTokenCallback(authority, resource, scope));

                // add the Key Vault &quot;provider&quot; that scans the KV, loading secrets into configuration
                builder.AddAzureKeyVault(config[&quot;KeyVault:BaseUrl&quot;], keyvaultClient, new PrefixKeyVaultSecretManager());
            }
        })
        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>These additional lines of code essentially does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only runs the Key Vault loading code when runningin production (so you don&#39;t override your development settings)</li>
<li>Gets the MSI token from the running web app</li>
<li>Creates a client to talk to the Key Vault through, using the token for an authorization context</li>
<li>Adds the Key Vault &quot;provider&quot; into the pipeline that builds the configuration file. It also assumes a configuration file value of &quot;KeyVault:BaseUrl&quot; is present</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, let&#39;s head on over to the configuration file and make a few changes:</p>
<p>Change the database connection string back to the MS SQL Local DB value (this way, we&#39;ll dev in our local environment):</p>
<pre><code>Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ContosoUniversity3;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true
</code></pre><p>Add a key/value pair for the <em>KeyVault:BaseUrl</em>. Be sure to substitute the URL of your Key Vault (you can find it in the Azure Portal).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">  &quot;KeyVault&quot;: {
    &quot;BaseUrl&quot;: &quot;{your_keyvault_url_goes_here}&quot;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This is what my configuration file looks like when I&#39;m finished:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/config.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>To test your changes, run your app locally and add a new student. Then, publish your app to Azure. Navigate to the app&#39;s Azure URL and verify that the student you previously added isn&#39;t present.</p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 

<h3 id="adding-authentication-to-your-app">Adding Authentication to your App</h3>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve secured our app&#39;s secrets in the Key Vault, it&#39;s time to worry about the app itself! So far, anybody can access Contoso University&#39;s site and make changes. Let&#39;s lock it down.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Adding Authentication to Contoso University&#39;s app
</h4>

<p>This is a lot easier than you may think ;-)</p>
<p>Navigate to your web app in the Azure portal and select the &quot;Authentication / Authorization&quot; option on the left.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/auth.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Change the <em>App Service Authentication</em> option to <em>On</em>, select <em>Log in with Azure Active Directory</em> form the drop down. Then, click <em>Azure Active Directory</em> authentication provider.</p>
<p>On the next screen, select <em>Express</em> management mode, and press <em>Ok</em>. Accept all other defaults.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/aad-auth.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>Press <em>Save</em> at top.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it. Your app is now secured by Azure Active Directory. Anyone trying to access the site willbe automatically prompted to login. Try it. The first time you access it, it will prompt you to login (or detect that you&#39;re already logged into the Azure portal with the same credentials) and ask you for consent to read your login profile. Accept it.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter3/prompt.png" class="img-medium" /></p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 

<p>Phew. This was a long chapter, but you learned some important cloud-native ways of securing secrets with the Key Vault.</p>

				<h2 id="custom-speech-service-models">Custom Speech Service Models</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you&#39;ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>perform testing on Microsoft&#39;s base models</li>
<li>train acoustic and language models</li>
<li>demonstrate that your hard work of creating custom models pays off by dramatically increasing the accuracy of Microsoft&#39;s base models</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>After creating Custom Speech Service (CSS) data sets, you need to instruct CSS to train models based on these data sets. </p>
<p>Training acoustic and language models is easy to do in the CSS portal - point and click. But, before we do that, we&#39;ll take a pit stop and establish a baseline accuracy of the CSS capabilities using Microsoft&#39;s base models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Base Models - What Are They?</strong></p>
<p>The CSS comes with several pre-trained acoustic and language models. In fact, there are different models for conversations and search/diction. If you stop to think about it, this makes a lot of sense. We tend to speak differently when we converse with others, as compared to dictating text or speaking search terms for a search engine. See below for the base models Microsoft provides.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter4/model1.png" class="img-override" /></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="testing-the-accuracy-of-the-base-models">Testing the Accuracy of the Base Models</h3>
<p>To understand the effect our CSS customization will have, it&#39;s important to establish a baseline accuracy for the CSS service against our testing data set.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started and see how the CSS does against some of these Pokemon names ;-)</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Performing an accuracy test on the Microsoft base model
</h4>

<p>Start by navigating to the CSS web portal at <a href="https://cris.ai" target="_blank">https://cris.ai</a>, and navigate to <em>Accuracy Tests</em>. </p>
<p><img src="images/chapter4/test1.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>This page shows the status of the past and ongoing accuracy tests performed by the CSS.</p>
<p>Click the <em>Create New</em> button to begin a test against an acoustic and language model.</p>
<p>Complete the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locale: en-US</li>
<li>Subscription: <em>the one you created earlier</em></li>
<li>Base Model: Microsoft Search and Diction Model, then select the base acoustic and base language models below</li>
<li>Acoustic Data: Pokemon - Acoustic Data - Testing</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/chapter4/test2.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Click <em>Create</em> to begin the test run.</p>
<p>When the test run is saved, you&#39;ll navigate back to the <em>Accuracy Test Results</em> page:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter4/test3.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Note the <em>Status</em> of the test run is <em>NotStarted</em>. In a few moments, it will change to <em>Running</em>, then <em>Succeeded</em>.</p>
<p>The test run may take some time to execute (up to 10 minutes). So, it&#39;s a good time to take a short break. Check back in 5.</p>

<p>Hi, welcome back. I wish you had just won $1700. Will you settle for a lousy accuracy test?</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s check back in on the accuracy test.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter4/test4.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Ugh! 45% word error rate - not good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Word Error Rate (WER)</strong></p>
<p>&#39;WER&#39; (Word Error Rate) and &#39;Word Accuracy&#39; are the best measurements to take when comparing two utterances, these are typically values in % and are derived by comparing a reference transcript with the speech-to-text generated transcript (or hypothesis) for the audio. In our case, the reference transcript is the transcript file we supplied for the testing data set, and the speech-to-text generated transcript (or hypothesis) is what the CSS generated when it processed the 6 audio files in the testing dataset.</p>
<p>The algorithm used is called the Levenshtein distance, it is calculated by aligning the reference with hypothesis and counting the words that are Insertions, Deletions, and Substitutions. </p>
<p>In general, WER is fairly complex to calculate. We won&#39;t dive much deeper, but if you&#39;re interested in learning more, check out <a href="http://blog.voicebase.com/how-to-compare-speech-engine-accuracy">this website</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, 45% error rate is still pretty high. Let&#39;s explore the results of the accuracy test.</p>
<p>Click the <em>Details</em> link to learn more. At the bottom of the page, you&#39;ll find the detailed transcription (we provided that) and the hypothesis (decoder output).</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter4/test5.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>You should notice several mis-interpretations, as the CSS had trouble with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pikachu</li>
<li>Meowth</li>
<li>Jigglypuff</li>
<li>Wink at me</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#39;s interesting is that aside from the Pokemon names, the CSS did a pretty good job. It got confused a bit about winking, but perhaps I didn&#39;t annunciate very well in the test files. We&#39;ll see later on.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is our testing data set is <em>SMALL</em>. Really small. In fact, there are only ~30 words in the entire data set. That&#39;s really too small, and for each word missed, we add ~3% word error rate. In a production system, we&#39;d want hundreds of utterances, and thousands of words in a testing data set. So, keep that in mind for future endeavors.</p>
<p>This concludes the exercise. </p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>  

<p>I know we can do better then 45%, and we will as we build our own acoustic and language models. </p>
