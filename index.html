<h3 id="preparing-your-azure-environment">Preparing your Azure environment</h3>
<p>You might be wondering how you can participate in a cloud development workshop and not need any software installed.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Azure Resource Manager and some nifty templates I put together, we&#39;re going to provision a virtual machine (VM) with Visual Studio (and all the tools you&#39;ll need) installed in your Azure subscription. From that point forward, you can work from the VM. </p>
<p>It takes about 10 minutes to get the VM deployed to your subscription, so let&#39;s get started!</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Provisioning a Visual Studio Community VM in your Azure Subscription
</h4>

<p>Start by clicking the <em>Deploy to Azure</em> button below.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmikebranstein%2Fvscommunity-workshop-vm%2Fmaster%2Ftemplate.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" class="img-override" /></a></p>
<p>This opens the Azure portal in a new tab of your browser. If you&#39;re prompted to sign in, do so. </p>
<p>When the page loads, you&#39;ll see this custom deployment page:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter0/custom-deployment.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<h4 id="under-basics-select-enter-the-following">Under <em>Basics</em>, select/enter the following</h4>
<ul>
<li>Subscription: <em>your Azure subscription</em></li>
<li>Resource group: <em>Create new</em></li>
<li>Resource group name: <em>workshop-vm</em>, or some other name that&#39;s easy to remember</li>
<li>Location: <em>East US</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resource Groups</strong> </p>
<p>Formally, resource groups provide a way to monitor, control access, provision and manage billing for collections of assets that are required to run an application, or used by a client or company department. Informally, think of resource groups like a file system folder, but instead of holding files and other folders, resource groups hold azure objects like storage accounts, web apps, functions, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="under-settings-enter">Under <em>Settings</em>, enter</h4>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Machine Name: <em>workshop-vm</em>, or some other name that is less than 15 characters long, and no special characters</li>
<li>Admin Username: <em>your first name</em>, or some other username without spaces</li>
<li>Admin Password: <em>P@ssW0rd1234</em>, or another 12-character password with upper, lower, numbers, and a special character </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> </p>
<p>Do not forget your username and password. Write it down for today. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="approving-the-purchase">Approving the &quot;Purchase&quot;</h4>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click two boxes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I agree to the terms and conditions stated above</li>
<li>Pin to dashboard</li>
</ol>
<p>Press the <em>Purchase</em> button.</p>
<h4 id="deploying-the-vm">Deploying the VM</h4>
<p>After a few moments, the deployment of your VM will begin, and you&#39;ll see a status notification in the upper right:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter0/deployment-start1.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>...and a deployment tile on your dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter0/deployment-start2.png" class="img-override" /></p>
<p>Now, wait for about 10 minutes and your virtual machine will be deployed and ready to use.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>That&#39;s it for the pre-requisites for today&#39;s workshop. Wait until your VM is created, and we&#39;ll be getting started soon!</p>
